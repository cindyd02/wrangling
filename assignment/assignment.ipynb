        "  > From the abstract, this paper is about data tidying, an important component of data cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  > A standard would make the intial data cleaning easier as one doesn't have to start from scratch. So a tidy data standard is to help make data analysis easier and more efficient by establishing a standard way to organize data values in a dataset. \n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  > The first sentence means that a tidy datatset follow a consistent structure, making them similar to each other. However, a messy dataset can have a variety of inconsistencies, making each one unique in its own way.\n",

        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "  > Values: numbers (quantitative) or strings (qualitative). Values are organized in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable, which contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units (ex. height, temperature, money), and observations, which contains all values measured on the same unit (ex. person, day, race).\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "  - Each variable forms a column\n",
        "  - Each observation forms a row\n",
        "  - Each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        " > The 5 most common problems with a messy dataset are:\n",
        "  - Column headers are values, not variable names\n",
        "  - Multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
        "  - Variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "  - Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "  - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "> The data in Table 4 is messy because the incomes are used as column headers instead of being values in a single column. Should be 'religion', a new column called'income', and 'frequency.' Melting a dataset is essentially turning column values into rows. \n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  > Table 11 is messy because there is column for each possible day in the month, some days/months do not have value and is left blank. However table 12 melts all the days into a single variable 'date'. The missing values are dropped to conserve space and each row represents the meterological measurements for a single day.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  > The “chicken-and-egg” problem with tidy data is about whether to clean and organize data before analysis or to analyze messy data and tidy it as needed. Hadley Wickham hopes future work will create better tools and practices for efficient data tidying, making it easier for data scientists to work with data seamlessly across different programming languages."
